# About


# Assumptions

First, I want to acknowledge some fairly large assumptions I made about the generation of this data from my project due to time constraints, which make the generated data an unrealistic representation of the nature of the hotel visitation. I assumed that:

* All hotels were acquired or have been by the very first start transaction date
* The patron visitation and stay durations are not representative of the patterns described in reality. However, I list here some of the  'triggers' that can attribute to patron traffic ebbs and flows:
    * holidays (civic and statutory, regional (locally and internationally))
    * local events
    * entertainment
* Sales amounts are in CAD

# Limitations

* Lack of data models for:
    * customer loyalty
    * promotions
    * costing
* Does not account for fixed and variable costs such as: 
    * infrastructure related maintenance and changes
    * administration
    * staffing payroll and wage increases
    * inflation
    * legal fees and the like
    * land taxation
